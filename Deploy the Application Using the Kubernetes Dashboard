Industry Relevance :

The following tools utilized in this project are widely applied in the industry:

1. kubeadm: A utility that offers kubeadm init and kubeadm join as efficient ways to bootstrap Kubernetes clusters. It focuses on bootstrapping rather than machine provisioning.

2. kubectl: A command-line interface for Kubernetes that allows execution of commands against Kubernetes clusters. It can be used for deploying applications, managing cluster resources, and viewing logs.

3. kubelet: An essential node agent present on every node in a Kubernetes cluster. It ensures that the containers described in the provided PodSpecs are running and healthy.

4. Docker: Docker is a tool designed to facilitate developers in building, sharing, and running applications in containers. It takes care of the setup, allowing developers to concentrate on the code.
